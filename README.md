## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icon library

### What I learned

In this project I leared to use Vue.js 3 and their new composition API.<br />
Also I estimate 15 hours for this project but in the end I did it in 13.

I like to put special attention to details, like hover, focus and focus-visible
effects.

### Useful resources

- [Vue.js 3 documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/) - This helped me for
  understand the new composition API and examples in Single File Components.
